Nagareteku toki no naka de demo kedarusa ga hora guruguru mawatte
Watashi kara hanareru kokoro mo mienaiwa sou shiranai?

Even in the midst of flowing time, I feel languid, look, spinning around and around.
I can't even see the heart that's leaving me, didn't you know?

Jibun kara ugoku koto mo naku toki no sukima ni nagasare tsuzukete
Shiranai wa mawari no koto nado watashi wa watashi sore dake

I can't even get myself to move, I continue to be washed down the cracks of time.
I don't know anything about what's around me, I'm just me and no more.

Yume miteru? Nani mo mitenai? Kataru mo muda na jibun no kotoba
Kanashimu nante tsukareru dake yo nani mo kanjizu sugoseba ii no

Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing? My words are useless even if I speak.
I'm just tired of being sad, I should go on without feeling anything.

Tomadou kotoba ataerarete mo jibun no kokoro tada uwa no sora
Moshi watashi kara ugoku no naraba subete kaeru no nara kuro ni suru

Even if you give me the words I'm at a loss for, my heart just won't pay attention.
If I move myself away, if I change everything, I値l turn it all black.

Konna jibun ni mirai wa aru no? Konna sekai ni watashi wa iru no?
Ima setsunai no? Ima kanashii no? Jibun no koto mo wakaranai mama

Is there a future for someone like me? Will I still exist in a world like this?
Is this painful? Is it sad? Not even knowing myself.

Ayumu koto sae tsukareru dake yo hito no koto nado shiri mo shinaiwa
Konna watashi mo kawareru no nara moshi kawareru no nara shiro ni naru?

I'm just tired even of walking, I don't even understand people.
If someone like me can change, if I can change, will I turn white?

Nagareteku toki no naka de demo kedarusa ga hora guruguru mawatte
Watashi kara hanareru kokoro mo mienaiwa sou shiranai?

Even in the midst of flowing time, I feel languid, look, spinning around and around.
I can't even see the heart that's leaving me, didn't you know?

Jibun kara ugoku koto mo naku toki no sukima ni nagasare tsuzukete
Shiranai wa mawari no koto nado watashi wa watashi sore dake

I can't even get myself to move, I continue to be washed down the cracks of time.
I don't know anything about what's around me, I'm just me and no more.

Yume miteru? Nani mo mitenai? Kataru mo muda na jibun no kotoba
Kanashimu nante tsukareru dake yo nani mo kanjizu sugoseba ii no

Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing? My words are useless even if I speak.
I'm just tired of being sad, I should go on without feeling anything.

Tomadou kotoba ataerarete mo jibun no kokoro tada uwa no sora
Moshi watashi kara ugoku no naraba subete kaeru no nara kuro ni suru

Even if you give me the words I'm at a loss for, my heart just won't pay attention.
If I can move, if I change everything, I値l turn it all black.

Muda na jikan ni mirai wa aru no? Konna tokoro ni watashi wa iru no?
Watashi no koto o iitai naraba kotoba ni suru no nara "roku de nashi"

Does a future exist in wasted time? Do I exist in a place like this?
If I want to talk about me, if I make myself heard, I'll say I'm "good-for-nothing"

Konna na tokoro ni watashi wa iru no? Konna na jikan ni watashi wa iru no?
Konna watashi mo kawareru no nara moshi kawareru no nara shiro ni naru?

Do I exist at a place like this? Do I exist at a time like this?
If someone like me can change, if I can change, will I turn white?

Ima yume miteru? Nani mo mitenai? Kataru mo muda na jibun no kotoba?
Kanashimu nante tsukareru dake yo nani mo kanjizu sugoseba ii no

Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing? My words are useless even if I speak.
I'm just tired of being sad, I should go on without feeling anything.

Tomadou kotoba ataerarete mo jibun no kokoro tada uwa no sora
Moshi watashi kara ugoku no naraba subete kaeru no nara kuro ni suru

Even if you give me the words I'm at a loss for, my heart just won't pay attention.
If I can move, if I change everything, I値l turn it all black.

Ugoku no naraba ugoku no naraba subete kowasuwa subete kowasuwa
Kanashimu naraba kanashimu naraba watashi no kokoro shiroku kawareru?

If I move, if I move, I値l destroy everything, I値l destroy everything.
If I grieve, if I grieve, can my heart turn white?

Anata no koto mo watashi no koto mo subete no koto mo mada shiranai no
Omoi mabuta wo aketa no naraba subete kowasu no nara kuro ni nare!!!

I still don稚 know about you, about myself, about everything.
If I can open my heavy eyelids, if I break everything, then turn black!!!
